conque++
===========

This is a fork of conque-term, originally available at http://code.google.com/p/conque/. Conque-term lets you run a shell inside vim, which is awesome.

Conque++ fixes some bugs in conque-term and adds additional configuration options.

You can play nethack in vim using conque++. If you don't think that's cool, you have no soul.
